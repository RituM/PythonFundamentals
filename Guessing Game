# This is a number guess game. The program will compare your guess with a secret number to determine if you've guessed the number successfully.
# This program uses a while/else loop



# Designate a secret number
secret_number = 9 

# Designate the max number of guesses
max_guess = 3

# Designate the number of guesses and initialize to 0
guess_count = 0

# Loop through guesses while they are less than the max number
while guess_count < max_guess: # python loop will execute for guess = 0,1,2 so 3x, set guess < 3
    
    guess = int(input("Guess: ")) # take in user guess as an int
    
    guess += 1 # increment guess_count
    
    if guess == secret_number: # compare user guess to secret number
        # Tell user of successful guess
        print("You won!")
        
        # terminate program
        break
        
# Else condition which tells user that they're out of guesses
    print("Sorry you're out of guesses!")
